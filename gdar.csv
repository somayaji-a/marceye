","Driver 1: Adherence to Fundamentals & Standards (Hazard Identification)
Recent events indicate a lack of adherence to hazard identification, and mitigation or mitigation of the hazard.
In some cases, the hazard is identified, and workers choose to work around the hazard rather than correct the condition or add barriers mitigate or eliminate the hazard. This insight may contribute to an increase in frequency and severity of events in A2241.

Driver 2: Supervisor Training on Hazard Identification and Mitigation 
Supervisors are not proficient in identifying gaps to standards, and identifying safety hazards with a bias towards elimination.  Supervisors do not have a clear understanding of the standards within BP-SM-00064, Hazard identification
 
Driver 3: Plant Material Condition, Housekeeping, and Long-Standing Safety Deficiencies
Several recent events have been caused by Plant Material Condition, Poor Housekeeping, and Long-Standing Safety Deficiency (SH/SI) coded Work Orders (e.g. amenities building slip and fall).

Driver 4: Visibility of Safety Performance Monitoring of Workgroups 
Industrial Safety performance monitoring lacks a graded approach to detecting declining worker performance down to the section level of the organization.  There is no proactive performance trending to ensure workgroups detect performance gaps early, and take ownership of their performance with the formal oversight of the Industrial Safety Department and Senior Leadership team.

","1. Not all Clearance Requests provide all information required to ensure adequate Worker Protection during CL preparation and approval.

2. Recent gains made in reducing the number of rush clearance preparation and approval are not being adequately measured and monitored to ensure that these improvements are sustained over the long-term.

3. Not all L4 WP events are being categorized, having an SCR entered, and being flagged as a L4 WP event in Maximo. This is reducing the ability for organizational learning from L4 events, and leading to missed opportunities for event prevention through the use of historical trending to identify and correct underlying causes proactively.","R1. Further reduce WP event likelihood through improvement of self-awareness and continuous improvement of overall CR quality performance.

R1. 100% CR quality (at initial entry) and 100% CR quality (at CL preparation). 

R2. Improved engagement at all levels of the Operations Organization as demonstrated through survey results. 

R2. Operations Engagement council taking action at the correct level of the organization to improve performance and reduce worker frustration.

R3. Entire organization is able to access and learn from past L4 WP events.

","April generation was better than plan (0.7 forced outage days compared to 3.5 in the plan, partially offset by U5 derates), and therefore the driver for the higher than plan Cost/MWh was higher costs.

Little TCD 1Jan2023","-	Procedure / Work Instruction Quality (Identified hold points). In many examples explored as part of the interview process we heard from the floor workers “I knew I should have gone back and verified that work” this comment was being made in situations where we have assigned app a workers to a job and there is skill of the trade involved in the work. There were also a couple situations where we should have used hold points to allow our Siemens contractors to verify measurements / tolerances. This did not happen.
-	Quality Work Preparation. Resource limits are not assigned to ensure quality of walk downs. These walk downs are completed as time allows. Contributing to this gap is parts are not always being on site to allow Maintenance the opportunity to ensure they are correct.
-	Projects Oversight. Projects are not well supported from the station maintenance perspective. BTU workers will not always have the OPEX from issues identified during operating conditions. Contributing to this gap is we do not follow the AFS process, Projects are turned over to maintenance without training on the new equipment and in some cases process drawings and even manuals are not always complete with quality.

9.	AOM-T/GOAL to review all supplemental staff training material related to PSC/Protected Equipment behaviors, review identified gaps with station standards councils and implement corrective actions.
10.	GOAL to convene fleet level review of contractor PSC performance & associated improvement plans. Corrective actions to be assigned with PARB oversight.
11.	Implement BP-PROC-00734 alteration post A2241 to utilize Maintenance Tags as official means of PSC. Change management plan to include EPD corrective action & oversight structure that ensures strict adherence to Maintenance Alteration Log requirement.
12.	With support from Station Standards Councils & GOAL,
a.	Benchmark/implement governance for sensitive MCR/field device identification and hardening.
b.	Benchmark/implement governance for control/switch blocking during planned manipulations/testing.
c.	Develop strategy for work screening, task development and implementation of proactive equipment protection measures during job preparation.

All actions have been agreed to by the BA Ops Div Manager, BB Ops Div Manager, and GOAL Director, Operational Focus","DRIVERS (Gap 1):
(1) Station leaders have not ensured that trainer performance/reinforcement of PSC behaviors in U0 is consistent with the reactor units, 
(2) Leadership presence during plant evolutions, training scenarios & simulator debriefs is inconsistent in U0, 
(3) Inconsistent enforcement of verbatim PU&A requirement (e.g. allowance of skill of trade manipulation of U0 13.8 kV breakers, development/execution of WCPs),
(4) Robust approach to the assessment/management of proficiency has not been implemented at the crew level.

DRIVERS (Gap 2):
(1) Inadequate onboarding & refresher training [worker/supervisor PSC & protected pathway knowledge], 
(2) Inadequate supervisory reinforcement of standards among supplemental staff, 
(3) Contractor improvement plans do not specifically address PSC behaviors, 
(4) Inconsistent use of Maintenance Alteration Logs.

DRIVERS (Gap 3):
(1) Risk-based procedure/governance does not exist to specify threshold/means for sensitive equipment hardening, 
(2) Operations expectations for blocking/neighboring component protection during planned evolutions/testing do not exist,
(3) Job preparation expectations do not include a requirement for joint OPS/Mtce identification/implementation of equipment protection measures.
